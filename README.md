## General info
This project was created on Processing 4, to create an animation smoothly. 
My project's intention and purpose is to teach the alphabet in a manner that is easy to engage with and simple to understand, with simple images, colours and music that syncs up with the images. 
I decided to create this project as I have an interest in diverse education and the development of young minds, exploring alternative ways that this can be done.
